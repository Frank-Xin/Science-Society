                        <h3>COVID-19 Prevention and Care</h3>
                        <p>
                            COVID-19, also known as the Novel Coronavirus is a virus which falls in the same genetic family as MERS and SARs. All three of these Coronaviruses caused problems, but the current one is the one that has the largest range of effect, spreading across 6
                            continents within 3 months. The CDC (Center of Disease Control) has put a Level 2 travel advisory on most areas, which means that extra precautions have to be taken in order to not be infected by the virus.

                            Besides the actual pandemic raging across the globe, there is another type of pandemic: the “Infodemic”. At times of hardship, generally, the public’s reliance on information tend to rise monumentally. Some individuals, however, take advantage of this
                            situation, exploiting it to an extent where they would purposely use this fear to cause widespread dissemination of fake information.

                        <p>
                            With the rapid rise of COVID-19, scientists around the world are finding ways to help combat this calamity; one major tool being used right now is machine learning. Scientists from DeepMind are using computational chemistry datasets on their deep learning
                            algorithms to predict the protein structure of the corona virus. By gaining an insight to the structure of the virus, scientists can then find effective drugs and vaccines to fight the virus quicker.

                            SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, has taken the lives of 10,000 people around the world, and sickened more than 250,000 people with COVID-19 pneumonia. It is the 3rd newly discovered coronavirus of the century, following the outbreaks of SARS and MERS
                            in Asia and the Middle East respectively.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            With the number of cases and deaths due to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) consistently on the rise globally, this pandemic has reached a total of six continents and has impacted countless of lives. Hence the wonder– what may potentially halt the spread
                            of SARS-CoV-2? This section of the article investigates potential endings to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic including heat, treatment, a natural trickle off, and containment.
